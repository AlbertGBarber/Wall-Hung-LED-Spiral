Full instructions coming soon. For now, you might be able to piece things together using the images, print, and layout files. You can DM on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/splat2385/) with any questions. 

My addressable LED library, <a href="https://github.com/AlbertGBarber/PixelSpork">Pixel Spork</a> was used to create the effects.

For the build, you'll need a couple of my custom PCB's. You can find them <a href="https://github.com/AlbertGBarber/General-PCBs/tree/master/photoresistor%20mount">here</a> 
and <a href="https://github.com/AlbertGBarber/General-PCBs/blob/master/Wemos%20lipo%20charger%20combo/Gerber_We_Lipo%20Combo_W_LLC_3v3_reg_PCB_2020-07-19_11-51-27.zip">here.</a>
They are for mounting the Wemos D1 mini controller and the spiral's light sensor.

The central crystal is a circular 76mm diameter suncatcher I bought on Aliexpress: <a href="https://a.aliexpress.com/_mtR4YlD">here.</a> (Make sure you pick the 76mm diameter option). 
The LEDs are "pebble" style WS2812b's 1ith 10mm spacing, just search for them on Aliexpress. Otherwise everything else should be easily findable. 
You'll need a 5V 10A power adapted to power the whole thing. 
The hanging hooks I used are hand-bag hooks that you can find on Amazon. They should have an M3 screw thread.
For the segment panels I used simple resume paper (0.2mm thick).
